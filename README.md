In this work, we establish the Siamese network LLPS models which can integrates the ESM2 embedding features and the Protein-Protein interaction networks embedding features for LLPS prediction.

deepNF_embedding.py : It can be used to created deep autoencoder models to extract the embedding features from Protein-Protein interaction networks.
node2vec_embedding.py: It can be used to create node2vec models to extract the embedding features from Protein-Protein interaction networks.
Siamese_network_LLPS.py: It can be used to create models based on Siamese networks for predicting liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins.
